# Testing
The python file is a program designed to test the `QE-index.html` based on the `QE-guide.html` guide. The html file is tested using the selenium web drive for python. The code should be 'self-documenting' with comments to help with comprehension.

# Getting Started
1. Clone the repo and cd into the repo.
2. Ensure you have python3 installed and pip installed.
3. Install pytest using `pip install pytest` and install selenium using `pip install selenium`.
4. Run the python file using `pytest .\test_qe.py`.
5. You should expect all 6 test cases should pass.
